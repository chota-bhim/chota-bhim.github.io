    One day while playing table tennis with my friends in my friend's house,
    the ball of the table tennis went inside the basement. We all went down to
    fetch the ball and discovered a big metallic structure with a big cover
    which looked very dusty. I asked my friend what it was, as it was his house.
    But then he said that he didn't know and said that it was not his and it was
    not there before. We all went up and asked his parents if they had bought
    it. But they all said no. They too went down to check but told that they
    didn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
    We pulled down the big cover. It was even dusty inside. We started dusting
    the machine with a broom. We found some buttons but still could not
    understand what it was. We found a control panel on the machine. We also
    found papers, and a remote lying around. The paper looked like the manual
    of the thing. On reading the manual we understood how it and the remote
    worked. We all exclaimed as we had found a <i><b>Time Travel Machine</i></b>.
    The remote was used to come back if we would go anywhere. The machine would take us
    anywhere in the past and also in the future. It had many working systems.
    We were all very excited.
    </p>
    <p>
    I said to my friends that I would go to the future and check when the
    earth would be destroyed and how. My friends said that they would go to
    Delhi sultanate free of cost and just in a few seconds. we all agreed with
    each other with all the plans. Some of our friends said that they could not
    go if their parents denied it. I said that I would talk to their parents
    about it. Then their parents hesitated but agreed when we allowed their
    parents to come with us. we all packed the bags and stood ready to go.
    </p>

    We first decided to go to the Mughal Period. I took my luggage and my
    friend took the remote of the machine. I also had an electric drone
    with me to sell and get some identical coins at that time. We typed
    "Mughal Period after Shah Jahan" on the machine and a big black like
    structure pulled us in. We were all afraid for some time but calmed
    reaching the place. We could understand that the machine worked properly
    as it was the "Mughal Period" as people wore clothes of that time and the
    shops were very different.
    </p>
    <p>
    We walked some distance and found the market. I thought of selling the drone
    that I had bought with me. I sold it and got some silver coins. I also told
    them how it worked. They were very surprised. the people there asked about
    us but we somehow escaped those questions. We wanted to stay there for a
    long time but due to our father's work and our schools, we had to come back.
    The <i><u>rupia</i></u> was different from ours. We went to a shop and ate
    <i>roti sabji</i> found there. We came back home when nobody was there.
    </p>
    <p>
    From then on I always like to travel in time either in the past or future.
    I liked the people there and the way they lived. I also liked the clean
    and tidy place.
